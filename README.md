# Mercury

Mercury is a browser extension for quickly sharing links and tabs to [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/) and [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). You can click the extension's button in the top bar (or the keyboard shortcut) to share the current tab, or right-click a link on any page. You can also share a snippet of text by selecting it, then opening the context/right-click menu.

The browser extension can store multiple server options, and synchronize them with your browser's settings. It uses the share dialog hosted by the selected service or server, so no API access or account permissions are required.

Mercury is compatible with any Mastodon server, as well as platforms that have implemented Mastodon's share URL scheme, such as [Misskey](https://misskey-hub.net/en/). It also works with the [Elk](https://elk.zone/) Mastodon web client.
