# Privacy Policy for Share to Mastodon

Share to Mastodon is committed to respecting your privacy and being transparent about the collected data. This policy outlines what information is transmitted during the installation and use of Share to Mastodon, how it is used, and how you can control the collection.

## Information collected by Share to Mastodon

Share to Mastodon stores your server list and other settings in your web browser. That data may be synchronized to your other devices through your web browser's cloud account (e.g. a Firefox Account in Firefox). The extension itself does not transmit your server list or any other information about you or your device.

Share to Mastodon does not log into your accounts on Mastodon or other Fediverse platforms. When you select a server, the current page URL, text selection (if text was selected), and page title is forwarded to the compose window hosted by the selected server. No other information about the page is sent to the selected server. The extension does not authenticate with the servers or use Mastodon APIs.
